# 📖 Automatic novel（eBook） generation tool

This project is base on [AI_NovelGenerator](https://github.com/YILING0013/AI_NovelGenerator)

## 💎 In addition to the official functions, I have also added some new features:
 1. Supports the generation of novels in multiple languages, and the interface also supports multiple languages. Currently, only Chinese and English are available, but other languages ​​can be added easily.
 2. Automatically load the current chapter every time it starts
 3. The expansion function has been optimized. The original version can only be expanded once and the original content is rewrite each time. However, due to the limitations of the AI ​​model, it is impossible to write too long content once. Therefore, my approach now is to continue writing on the original content and superimpose the new content every time. In this way, after many operations, a long enough content can be generated.
 4. English counting is also supported during expansion
 5. Add a button to each content page to facilitate the copying of the current content directly
 6. Support increase and decrease the font size in editor

 The following is the official instructions (I made some changes based on this modified version):

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide
### 📌 Basic configuration（config.json）
```json
{
    "api_key": "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "interface_format": "OpenAI",
    "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "embedding_api_key": "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "embedding_interface_format": "OpenAI",
    "embedding_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "embedding_model_name": "text-embedding-ada-002",

    "word_number": 4000,
    "filepath": "D:/AI_NovelGenerator/filepath"
}
```

### 🔧 Configuration instructions
1. **Generate model configuration**
   - `api_key`: API key for big model service
   - `base_url`: API terminal address (fill in Ollama and other addresses for local services)
   - `interface_format`: Interface mode
   - `model_name`: Main Generative Model Name (such as gpt-4, claude-3, etc.)
   - `temperature`: Creativity parameters (0-1, the higher the higher the creative)
   - `max_tokens`: Maximum reply length of the model

2. **EmbeddingModel configuration**
   - `embedding_model_name`: Model name (such as Ollama's nomic-embed-text)
   - `embedding_url`: Service address
   - `embedding_retrieval_k`: 

3. **Novel parameter configuration**
   - `topic`: Core story theme
   - `genre`: Type of work
   - `num_chapters`: Total chapter count
   - `word_number`: Number of words in a single chapter
   - `filepath`: Generate file storage path

## 🚀 Operation instructions
### **Method 1: Use the Python interpreter**
```bash
python main.py
```
After execution, the GUI will be launched, and you can perform various operations in the graphical interface.

### **Method 2: Package as an executable file**
If you want to use this tool on a machine without a Python environment, you can use **PyInstaller** to package it:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller main.spec
```
After packaging, an executable file (such as `main.exe` under Windows) will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## 📘 Usage tutorial
1. **After starting, complete the basic parameter setting first：**  
   - **API Key & Base URL**（such as `https://api.openai.com/v1`）  
   - **Model name**（Such as `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o`, etc.）  
   - **Temperature** (0~1, determines the level of creative writing)
   - **Topic** (such as "AI Rebellion in Wasteland World")
   - **Genre** (such as "Science Fiction"/"Magic"/"Urban Fantasy")
   - **Number of chapters**, **Number of words per chapter** (such as 10 chapters, about 3000 words per chapter)
   - **Save path** (It is recommended to create a new output folder)
  
2. **Click "Step1. Generate architecture"**  
   - The system will generate:
     - `Novel_setting.txt`: Contains worldview, character information, thunder points and dark lines, etc.  
   - You can view or modify the architecture in the generated `Novel_setting.txt`.

3. **Click "Step2. Generate Outline"**  
   - The system will generate all chapters based on the completed `Novel_setting.txt` content:
     - `Novel_outline.txt`：Includes titles and brief tips for each chapter.
   - Chapter titles and descriptions can be viewed, modified, or supplemented in the generated file.

4. **Click "Step3. Generate Draft"**  
   - Before generating the chapter, you can: 
     - **Set chapter number**(If you generate Chapter 1, fill in `1`)
     - **Providing any expectations or tips for the plot of this chapter in the "Guide to this chapter" input box**
   - After clicking the button, the system will:
     - Automatically read the previous settings, `Novel_outline.txt`, and finalized chapters
     - Call vector search and review the plot to ensure context coherence
     - Outline of Generating the Chapter (`outline_X.txt`) and Text (`chapter_X.txt`)
   - After the generation is completed, you can view and edit the draft content of this chapter in the text box on the left.

5. **Click "Step4. Final chapter"**  
   - The system will:  
     - **Update global summary** (write `global_summary.txt`)
     - **Update role status** (write to `character_state.txt`)
     - **Update the vector search library** (Make sure that subsequent chapters can call the latest information)
     - **Update plot points** (such as `plot_arcs.txt`)
   - After the finalization is completed, you can see the finalized text in `chapter_X.txt`.

6. **Consistency check (optional)**
   - Click the "[Optional] Consistency Review" button to detect conflicts on the latest chapters, such as character logic, plot inconsistencies, etc.
   - If there is a conflict, a detailed prompt will be output in the log area.

7. **Repeat steps 4-6** until all chapters are generated and finalized!
   
> **Vector search configuration tips**  
> 1. The embedding model needs to display the specified interface and model name;
> 2. When using the **Embedding** of local Ollama**, you need to start the Ollama service in advance:
>    ```bash
>    ollama serve  # Start the service
>    ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # Download/Enable the model
>    ```
> 3. It is recommended to clear the vectorstore directory after switching different Embedding models.
> 4. Cloud Embedding must ensure that the corresponding API permissions are enabled

8. **Detail introduction**

## ❓ Troubleshooting
### Q1: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

This problem is most likely due to the API not responding correctly, maybe it responds to an html? Other contents lead to the error;


### Q2: HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout？
Confirm whether the interface is stable;

### Q3:How to switch between different Embedding providers?
Just enter the corresponding input in the GUI interface.
